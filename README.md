# Android Development Study Guide: Kotlin & Jetpack Compose

Welcome to my Modern Android Development Study Guide! This guide is designed to equip software development teams with the essential knowledge, tools, and best practices required to build robust, scalable, and secure Android applications using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and the latest Android development tools.

Each section includes references to official documentation, exercises to solidify understanding (based on code examples you'll build separately), and key concepts to remember.

##  Project Setup

Before diving into the topics, ensure you have the latest stable version of Android Studio. When creating a new project, select an "Empty Activity" template that uses Jetpack Compose. You'll need to configure your `build.gradle (:app)` file to include the necessary dependencies for Compose, Navigation, Ktor, Room, Hilt, and Testing, including applying the KSP plugin for Room and Hilt. Using the Compose Bill of Materials (BOM) is recommended for managing library versions.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basics of Jetpack Compose

This section introduces the fundamental principles of Jetpack Compose, a modern declarative UI toolkit for Android.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [Compose pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/compose)
    * [Thinking in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/mental-model)
    * [Compose layout basics](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/basics)
    * [@Composable functions](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/composable-functions)
    * [Previews in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling/previews)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create a basic composable file in your project.
    2.  Modify the initial `GreetingText` composable (from the example code you'll write) to accept an additional parameter, `greetingMessage: String`, and use it instead of a hardcoded message.
    3.  Add a new `@Composable` function called `FarewellText` that displays "Goodbye [name]!" and include it in the main screen composable.
    4.  Experiment with different parameters for the `@Preview` annotation (e.g., `widthDp`, `heightDp`, `uiMode`).

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **Declarative UI:** You describe *what* the UI should look like for a given state, not *how* to change it step-by-step. Compose takes care of updating the UI when the state changes.
    * **`@Composable` Functions:** These are the building blocks of your UI. They are regular Kotlin functions annotated with `@Composable`. They emit UI elements.
        * Must be called from another `@Composable` function.
        * Can execute in any order or in parallel.
        * Can be skipped if inputs haven't changed (recomposition optimization).
        * Cannot have side effects (e.g., modifying a global variable directly).
    * **UI Hierarchy:** Composable functions call other composable functions, forming a tree structure (hierarchy) of UI elements.
    * **Recomposition:** When the input state of a composable changes, Compose "recomposes" (re-runs) the function and updates the UI. This is an intelligent process that only updates what's necessary.
    * **`@Preview` Annotation:** Allows you to see your composables directly in Android Studio without running the app on an emulator or device. Essential for rapid UI development.
        * Previews require parameterless composable functions or those with default values for all parameters.
        * Use `showBackground = true` for better visibility.
    * **Project Setup:** Ensure your `build.gradle` files are correctly configured for Compose. Use the Compose Bill of Materials (BOM) to manage library versions.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Building UI Components

Learn to use foundational composables and modifiers to construct user interfaces.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [Basic layouts in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/basics) (Text, Image, Button, Column, Row, Box)
    * [Modifiers](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/modifiers)
    * [Compose lists and grids](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lists)
    * [ConstraintLayout in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/constraintlayout)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the UI components demo file. Add a placeholder image to your `res/drawable` directory (a simple square or icon will do).
    2.  Modify the `Button`'s `onClick` lambda in your example code to log a message to Logcat.
    3.  Change the `Image` composable to use `ContentScale.Fit`. Observe the difference in how the image is displayed.
    4.  In the `Row` composable, add a third `Text` element and make sure all elements are evenly spaced using `Arrangement`.
    5.  Extend the `SimpleList` (using `LazyColumn`) to display a `Card` for each item, containing the item text and a small `Icon`.

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **Core Composables:**
        * `Text`: Displays string data.
        * `Button`, `OutlinedButton`, `TextButton`: For user interactions.
        * `Image`: Displays drawable resources, bitmaps, vectors.
        * `Icon`: Displays Material icons or other vector drawables.
        * `TextField`: For user text input (covered more in "User Input").
        * `Column`: Arranges children vertically.
        * `Row`: Arranges children horizontally.
        * `Box`: Stacks children on top of each other; useful for overlapping elements or specific positioning.
    * **Modifiers:**
        * The backbone of styling and layout in Compose. Applied sequentially.
        * `Modifier.padding()`: Adds space around an element.
        * `Modifier.fillMaxWidth()`, `Modifier.fillMaxHeight()`, `Modifier.fillMaxSize()`: Make element occupy available space.
        * `Modifier.size()`: Sets a fixed width and height.
        * `Modifier.background()`: Sets background color.
        * `Modifier.clickable {}`: Makes an element interactive.
        * `Modifier.weight(1f)`: (In Row/Column) Distributes space proportionally.
    * **Alignment & Arrangement:**
        * `Column` uses `horizontalAlignment` (e.g., `Alignment.CenterHorizontally`) and `verticalArrangement` (e.g., `Arrangement.SpaceBetween`).
        * `Row` uses `verticalAlignment` (e.g., `Alignment.CenterVertically`) and `horizontalArrangement`.
        * `Box` uses `contentAlignment` (e.g., `Alignment.Center`).
    * **Lists (`LazyColumn`, `LazyRow`):**
        * Efficiently display scrollable lists of items. Only compose and lay out visible items.
        * Use `items(list) { item -> ... }` or `itemsIndexed(list) { index, item -> ... }`.
    * **Grids (`LazyVerticalGrid`, `LazyHorizontalGrid`):** Similar to lazy lists but for grid layouts.
    * **Constraints:** While `ConstraintLayout` is available for complex UIs, try to achieve layouts with `Column`, `Row`, and `Box` with modifiers first for simplicity. `ConstraintLayout` provides more power when relationships between many elements become complex.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Layouts and Design

Master advanced layout techniques and implement Material Design to create visually appealing and consistent UIs.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [Layouts in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts)
    * [Material Design 3 in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/design-systems/material3)
    * [Theming in Compose (Colors, Typography, Shapes)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/themes)
    * [ConstraintLayout in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/constraintlayout)
    * [Custom layouts](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/custom)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the layouts and design demo file.
    2.  In your project, navigate to `ui.theme/Theme.kt`. If it doesn't exist or is very basic, define a custom theme (color scheme, typography). Ensure your main `Activity`'s `setContent` block uses this theme.
    3.  Modify the `ComplexLayoutWithConstraintLayout` example code: Add another `Button` below the `subtitle` Text. Constrain it to be centered horizontally in the parent and below the `subtitle` and `image` (whichever is lower).
    4.  Customize your app's theme: Define a `ShapeScheme` (small, medium, large rounded corners) and apply it to the `MaterialTheme` composable. Use these shapes in the `Card` composables within your example.
    5.  Experiment with `Slot-based layouts` like `Scaffold`. Try adding a `BottomAppBar` to the `Scaffold` in your example.

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **Layout Composables Review:** `Column`, `Row`, `Box` are fundamental. `LazyColumn`, `LazyRow`, `LazyVerticalGrid` for efficient scrolling lists/grids.
    * **`Scaffold`:** A pre-defined Material Design layout structure providing slots for `TopAppBar`, `BottomAppBar`, `FloatingActionButton`, `Drawer`, and the main content area. It handles things like content padding based on app bars.
    * **`ConstraintLayout`:** For complex UIs where relationships between multiple composables are easier to define with constraints (relative positioning, chains, barriers, guidelines) than with nested Rows/Columns.
        * Create references using `createRefs()` or `createRefFor()`.
        * Apply constraints using the `Modifier.constrainAs(ref) { ... }` block.
        * `Dimension.fillToConstraints` is useful for elements like Text that need to wrap within constrained bounds.
    * **Material Design 3 (M3):** The latest version of Google's design system.
        * Compose provides M3 components: `androidx.compose.material3.*`.
        * Key M3 components: `Button`, `Card`, `TextField`, `TopAppBar`, `NavigationBar`, `NavigationRail`, `Checkbox`, `Switch`, etc.
    * **Theming:**
        * **`MaterialTheme`:** The top-level composable for applying theming.
        * **`ColorScheme`:** Defines the palette of colors (primary, secondary, surface, background, onPrimary, etc.). Use the Material Theme Builder tool to generate schemes.
        * **`Typography`:** Defines text styles (headline, body, caption, etc.) with font family, weight, size.
        * **`Shapes`:** Defines corner radius for components (small, medium, large).
    * **Custom Themes:** Create your own `ColorScheme`, `Typography`, and `Shapes` and pass them to `MaterialTheme` for a unique app look and feel.
    * **Dynamic Color:** On Android 12+, M3 can derive colors from the user's wallpaper.
    * **Slot APIs:** Many Material components use slot APIs (e.g., `TopAppBar` has `title`, `navigationIcon`, `actions` slots) where you provide composable lambdas to fill those parts.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Navigation and Routing

Implement navigation between different screens within your Compose application.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [Navigation in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)
    * [Navigate with arguments](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation#nav-with-args)
    * [Deep linking with Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation#deeplinks)
    * [Nested navigation graphs](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation#nested-nav)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the navigation demo file. Integrate the `AppNavigationHost` composable (defined in your example code) into your main activity's `setContent` block.
    2.  Add a third screen, `ProfileScreen`, to the `NavHost`.
    3.  Add a button to `HomeScreen` that navigates to `ProfileScreen`.
    4.  Modify `DetailsScreen` to accept an integer ID instead of a String. Update the navigation call and argument type in the `composable` definition within `NavHost`.
    5.  Test the deep link functionality for `DetailsScreen`. You can use ADB:
        `adb shell am start -d "https://www.example.com/details/test_deep_link_id" -a android.intent.action.VIEW`
        Ensure your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` is configured to catch this deep link for the relevant activity (add an appropriate `<intent-filter>` inside the `<activity>` tag).

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **`NavController`:** The central API for navigation. Responsible for managing the back stack and navigating between destinations. Get an instance using `rememberNavController()`.
    * **`NavHost`:** A composable that displays other composable destinations based on the current route. It links a `NavController` with a navigation graph.
    * **Navigation Graph:** Defined within the `NavHost` lambda. Use the `composable(route = "...") { ... }` function to define each destination.
    * **Routes:** Strings that uniquely identify a destination (e.g., "home", "profile/user123"). Use constants for routes.
    * **Navigating:** Use `navController.navigate("route")`.
    * **Passing Arguments:**
        * Define arguments in the route string: `"details/{itemId}"`.
        * Specify argument types using `arguments = listOf(navArgument("itemId") { type = NavType.StringType })`.
        * Retrieve arguments in the destination composable from `backStackEntry.arguments`.
    * **Optional Arguments & Default Values:** Arguments can be made optional (`nullable = true` or by defining query parameters like `"details?itemId={itemId}"`) and can have default values.
    * **Deep Linking:** Allows users to navigate directly to a specific screen in your app from a URL. Defined with the `deepLinks` parameter in the `composable` function. Requires `AndroidManifest.xml` configuration.
    * **Navigation Actions:**
        * `navController.popBackStack()`: Goes to the previous destination.
        * `navController.navigate("route") { popUpTo("start_route") { inclusive = true } }`: Clears the back stack up to a certain destination before navigating.
    * **Nested Navigation Graphs:** For complex navigation, you can group related destinations into a nested graph using the `navigation(startDestination = ..., route = "...") { ... }` builder. This helps in organizing navigation logic.
    * **Type Safety:** Consider using a library or sealed classes to create type-safe routes and argument passing, especially in larger applications, to avoid stringly-typed errors.
    * **ViewModel Scoping:** ViewModels can be scoped to navigation graph routes, allowing sharing of ViewModels between screens within that graph.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ User Input and Interactions

Learn how to handle user input events and manage state effectively within your Compose applications.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [State in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state)
    * [TextField in Compose](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary#TextField(kotlin.String,kotlin.Function1,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Boolean,androidx.compose.ui.text.input.VisualTransformation,androidx.compose.foundation.interaction.MutableInteractionSource,androidx.compose.material3.TextFieldColors,androidx.compose.material3.TextFieldDefaults.shape,kotlin.Function0,kotlin.Function0,kotlin.Function0,kotlin.Function0,kotlin.Boolean,androidx.compose.ui.text.input.ImeAction,androidx.compose.ui.text.input.KeyboardType,androidx.compose.ui.text.TextStyle)) (Refer to `androidx.compose.material3.TextField`)
    * [Gestures in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/gestures)
    * [State and Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state) (Crucial for understanding how state works)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the user input demo file.
    2.  Add a `Checkbox` composable to the screen in your example code. Its checked state should be managed by a `rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(false) }` variable. Display a `Text` composable next to it that says "Agree to terms" and changes color based on whether the checkbox is checked.
    3.  Modify the counter button example: Add another button to decrement the count. Ensure the count cannot go below zero.
    4.  Explore other `KeyboardOptions` for the `TextField`, like `imeAction`. For example, set `imeAction = ImeAction.Search` and add a `KeyboardActions` handler to log a message when the search action is triggered on the keyboard.

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **State (`mutableStateOf`):** The core mechanism for making UI dynamic. When a `State<T>` object's value changes, Compose automatically triggers recomposition for composables that read this state.
    * **`remember`:** Used to store state within a composable across recompositions. The state is forgotten if the composable is removed from the composition (e.g., navigating away).
    * **`rememberSaveable`:** Similar to `remember`, but it also saves and restores state across Activity/Process recreation (e.g., screen rotation, low memory scenarios). Essential for preserving user input.
    * **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF):** State flows down (from state holder to UI elements that display it), and events flow up (from UI elements to state holder that updates the state).
        * Example: `TextField(value = text, onValueChange = { text = it })`. `text` (state) flows down to `value`. Keystrokes (events) flow up via `onValueChange`.
    * **Input Components:**
        * `TextField`, `OutlinedTextField`: For text input. Key parameters include `value`, `onValueChange`, `label`, `keyboardOptions`, `visualTransformation`, `trailingIcon`.
        * `Button`, `IconButton`, `FloatingActionButton`: For click actions.
        * `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `RadioButton`: For selection states.
    * **Event Handlers:** Lambdas like `onClick`, `onValueChange`, `onCheckedChange` that are triggered by user interactions. These handlers are where you typically update your state.
    * **Gesture Detection:**
        * `Modifier.clickable {}`: Simple click listener.
        * `Modifier.pointerInput {}`: More advanced gesture detection using `detectTapGestures` (for taps, double taps, long presses), `detectDragGestures`, `detectTransformGestures` (for pinch, zoom, rotate).
    * **`KeyboardOptions`:** Customize keyboard behavior (e.g., `keyboardType = KeyboardType.Email`, `imeAction = ImeAction.Done`).
    * **`VisualTransformation`:** Modify how text is displayed (e.g., `PasswordVisualTransformation`).

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ State and Side-Effects

Dive deeper into state management techniques and learn how to handle operations that occur outside the scope of composable functions (side-effects).

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [State and Jetpack Compose (Official Guide - revisit this)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state)
    * [State Hoisting](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#state-hoisting)
    * [ViewModel and LiveData/StateFlow with Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#viewmodels-source-of-truth)
    * [Side-effects in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects)
    * [Lifecycle of composables](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle)
    * [LaunchedEffect](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects#launchedeffect)
    * [rememberCoroutineScope](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects#remembercoroutinescope)
    * [DisposableEffect](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects#disposableeffect)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the state and side-effects demo file, including a simple `TimerViewModel`.
    2.  Modify the `TimerViewModel` to use `StateFlow` instead of `LiveData` for `elapsedTime`. Update the corresponding screen composable to collect from the `StateFlow` using `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` (you may need to add the `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-compose` dependency).
    3.  In the screen composable, add a `Button`. When this button is clicked, use `rememberCoroutineScope` to launch a coroutine that simulates fetching data (e.g., `delay(2000)`) and then updates a new `mutableStateOf` variable in the composable to display "Data Loaded".
    4.  Implement a `LaunchedEffect` that takes `elapsedTime` (from the ViewModel) as a key. Inside this effect, if `elapsedTime` reaches 10, show a `Snackbar` (you'll need a `SnackbarHostState` and `Scaffold` for this). Reset the timer or log a message.
    5.  Think about a scenario where `DisposableEffect` would be crucial (e.g., registering a broadcast receiver or a sensor listener when the composable is active and unregistering it when it's not). Describe how you would implement it conceptually.

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **State Hoisting:** The pattern of moving state ownership to a common ancestor of composables that need to read or modify it. This makes child composables stateless, more reusable, and easier to test. Parent passes state down and event callbacks up.
    * **`mutableStateOf`:** The primary way to create observable mutable state in Compose.
    * **ViewModel and Compose:** ViewModels (`androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel`) are the recommended solution for holding and managing UI-related state, especially state that needs to survive configuration changes or is shared across screens.
        * Use `viewModel()` composable function to get a ViewModel instance scoped to the current navigation destination or Activity/Fragment.
        * Expose data from ViewModel using `LiveData` or `StateFlow`.
    * **`LiveData.observeAsState()`:** Collects values from LiveData and represents them as Compose `State`.
    * **`StateFlow.collectAsState()` / `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`:** Collects values from a StateFlow and represents them as Compose `State`. `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` is lifecycle-aware and recommended for UI layer collection.
    * **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF):**
        * State flows down (e.g., ViewModel -> Composable).
        * Events flow up (e.g., Composable User Interaction -> ViewModel Method). This makes state changes predictable and traceable.
    * **Side Effects:** Operations that happen outside the scope of a composable function's execution, such as network requests, database operations, or logging. Compose provides specific tools to manage them safely.
    * **`LaunchedEffect(key1, key2, ...)`:** Executes a suspendable block when the composable enters the composition and re-launches if any of its `key` parameters change. Ideal for one-time operations or operations tied to specific state changes. If `key1` is `Unit`, it runs only once.
    * **`rememberCoroutineScope()`:** Returns a `CoroutineScope` tied to the composable's lifecycle. Use this to launch coroutines in response to UI events (e.g., button clicks) that are not directly tied to composition/recomposition. The scope is cancelled when the composable leaves the composition.
    * **`DisposableEffect(key1, key2, ...)`:** Executes a block when the composable enters the composition and an `onDispose` lambda when it leaves or if a key changes. Used for side effects that need cleanup (e.g., registering/unregistering listeners, observers).
    * **`produceState`:** Converts non-Compose state (like callbacks or flows) into Compose `State`.
    * **`derivedStateOf`:** Used to create a `State` object whose value is calculated based on other `State` objects. It only recomposes when its result actually changes, even if the underlying states recompose more frequently. Good for performance optimization.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Working with ViewModels

Understand how to apply the MVVM architecture pattern effectively with Jetpack Compose, managing reactive data streams and sharing state.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [ViewModel Overview](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
    * [State holders and UI State (includes ViewModels)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#viewmodels-source-of-truth)
    * [StateFlow and SharedFlow (Kotlin Coroutines)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html#stateflow-and-sharedflow)
    * [LiveData Overview](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
    * [Sharing ViewModels between composables (Navigation graph-scoped ViewModels)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#share-state-between-composables-with-viewmodels) (See "ViewModel scoped to the navigation graph")

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the ViewModel and Screen files for this section's example.
    2.  In the example `MyFeatureViewModel`, add a new function `resetCounter()` that sets the counter in the `_uiState` StateFlow back to 0.
    3.  Add a corresponding "Reset Counter" `Button` in the `MyFeatureContent` composable that calls this new ViewModel function via the event callback.
    4.  Imagine you have two screens in a navigation graph (e.g., `ItemListScreen` and `ItemDetailScreen`). How would you share a `SharedViewModel` instance between them so that both can observe and potentially modify shared data? (Hint: `hiltViewModel(rememberNavController().getBackStackEntry("parent_route"))` or `viewModel(navController.getBackStackEntry("parent_route"))`). Research and describe the approach.
    5.  Modify the `loadInitialData` function in the ViewModel to simulate a failing network request sometimes (e.g., randomly throw an exception). Ensure the `errorMessage` in the `MyFeatureUiState` data class is updated and displayed correctly on the screen composable.

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**
        * **Model:** Represents data and business logic (e.g., data sources, repositories).
        * **View:** The UI (in Compose, these are your Composable functions). It observes the ViewModel.
        * **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge. It prepares and manages data for the View. It holds UI state, survives configuration changes, and exposes data via observable types like `StateFlow` or `LiveData`.
    * **`viewModel()` Composable:** The standard way to obtain a ViewModel instance in a Composable. It's lifecycle-aware and provides the correct ViewModel instance (e.g., scoped to an Activity, Fragment, or Navigation graph entry).
    * **UI State:** A data class or object that represents everything the UI needs to render itself. It's good practice to have a single UI state object per screen or feature, exposed from the ViewModel. This makes state management more predictable.
    * **`StateFlow`:** A hot, observable flow that emits the current and subsequent state updates. Recommended for new Android development for managing UI state from ViewModels.
        * `MutableStateFlow`: The mutable version used within the ViewModel.
        * `asStateFlow()`: Exposes an immutable `StateFlow` to the UI.
        * `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`: The recommended way to collect `StateFlow` in the UI, as it's lifecycle-aware and stops collection when the UI is not visible, saving resources.
    * **`LiveData`:** Another observable data holder, lifecycle-aware. Still widely used, but `StateFlow` is often preferred for new Kotlin-based projects due to its integration with coroutines and more flexible operators.
        * `observeAsState()`: Collects `LiveData` in Compose.
    * **`viewModelScope`:** A `CoroutineScope` provided by the `ViewModel` KTX library. All coroutines launched by the ViewModel for its operations should use this scope, as they are automatically cancelled when the ViewModel is cleared.
    * **Sharing ViewModels:**
        * **Activity-scoped:** `viewModel()` by default in an Activity's Composable gives a ViewModel scoped to that Activity. All Composables in that Activity can share it.
        * **Navigation graph-scoped:** `viewModel(navController.getBackStackEntry("graph_route"))` allows a ViewModel to be shared across all destinations within a specific nested navigation graph. This is powerful for sharing state between related screens. (Use `hiltViewModel` similarly if using Hilt).
    * **Immutability for UI State:** Expose immutable state (e.g., `StateFlow<MyUiState>` instead of `MutableStateFlow<MyUiState>`) from the ViewModel to the UI. The UI should only be able to trigger actions on the ViewModel, which then updates its internal mutable state, causing the immutable public state to emit a new value. This enforces UDF.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ API Requests

Learn how to perform asynchronous network operations using Ktor, a modern Kotlin-first HTTP client, and handle common networking tasks like caching.

    * [Making requests with Ktor](https://ktor.io/docs/request.html)
    * [Android Caching Strategies](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/network/cache) (General principles, Ktor can integrate with OkHttp for advanced caching if needed, or implement HTTP caching headers)
    * [OkHttp Interceptors (if using OkHttp engine with Ktor for advanced caching/logging)](https://square.github.io/okhttp/interceptors/)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the necessary files for the API demo (DTO, ApiService, ViewModel, Screen).
    2.  Add `INTERNET` permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml`: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`.
    3.  Implement a "Create Post" feature:
        * Add a `createPost(post: PostDTO): PostDTO?` function to your `ApiService`.
        * Add a new state and function in your `ApiViewModel` to handle the creation of a post.
        * Add UI elements (e.g., `TextField`s for title and body, a Button) to your screen composable to collect input and trigger the create post action. Display the result or an error.
    4.  Research Ktor client plugins for caching (e.g., `HttpCache` or using an OkHttp engine with OkHttp's caching). Describe how you might implement a simple caching strategy for the `getPosts()` call.

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **Ktor Client:** A Kotlin-native, coroutine-based HTTP client. Flexible and extensible.
        * **Engines:** Ktor uses engines for actual HTTP communication (e.g., `Android`, `CIO`, `OkHttp`). `Android` engine is often a good default for Android.
        * **Plugins:** Enhance Ktor's functionality (e.g., `ContentNegotiation` for JSON/XML, `Logging`, `Auth`, `HttpCache`).
    * **Serialization:** `kotlinx.serialization` is typically used with Ktor to convert Kotlin objects to/from JSON. Annotate data classes with `@Serializable`.
    * **Making Requests:** Use `client.get()`, `client.post()`, `client.put()`, etc. These are `suspend` functions.
    * **Error Handling:** Network requests can fail. Use `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions (e.g., `HttpRequestTimeoutException`, `ClientRequestException`, `ServerResponseException`, general `IOException`). Convert these to user-friendly error messages or states in your ViewModel.
    * **ViewModel Integration:** ApiService calls are usually made from `viewModelScope` in the ViewModel. The ViewModel then updates its UI state (`StateFlow` or `LiveData`) with the results or errors.
    * **Caching:**
        * **HTTP Caching:** Rely on standard HTTP cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Expires`). Ktor's `HttpCache` plugin can handle this. If using OkHttp engine, OkHttp's built-in caching can be leveraged.
        * **Custom Caching:** For more complex offline strategies, you might cache data in a local database (Room) after fetching it from the API.
    * **Offline Capabilities:** Beyond caching, consider a "stale-while-revalidate" strategy or saving data to a local database (Room) to provide content even when offline. Show cached/local data first, then update from network if available.
    * **Closing Client:** It's good practice to call `client.close()` when it's no longer needed (e.g., in `ViewModel.onCleared()`) to release resources, especially if the client isn't managed as an application-scoped Singleton by DI.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Local Data Storage

Store data locally on the device using SharedPreferences for simple key-value pairs and Room for structured database persistence.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [SharedPreferences Overview](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences)
    * [Jetpack DataStore (Modern alternative to SharedPreferences)](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - *Consider this for new projects.*
    * [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)
    * [Room Entities](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data)
    * [Room DAOs (Data Access Objects)](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data)
    * [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/creating-database)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create all the specified files for the SharedPreferences and Room examples (Wrapper class, Entity, DAO, Database, ViewModel, Screen).
    2.  In your `AppPreferences` wrapper class, add a preference to store an integer (e.g., `launchCount`). Update the ViewModel and UI to display and increment this count each time the app (or this screen) is shown.
    3.  In the Room setup, add an "age" field to the `UserEntity`. You'll need to:
        * Update the entity class.
        * Increment the database `version` number in your `AppDatabase` class.
        * Provide a `Migration` strategy (e.g., `Room.databaseBuilder(...).addMigrations(MIGRATION_1_2)...`) or use `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` for development (this will clear data). Research how to write a simple migration to add the new column using SQL.
        * Update the UI composable to include input and display for the new age field.
    4.  Explore Jetpack DataStore (Proto or Preferences DataStore) as a modern alternative to SharedPreferences. Briefly describe its advantages (e.g., asynchronous API with Flow, type safety with Proto).

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **SharedPreferences:**
        * Stores private primitive data in key-value pairs.
        * Good for simple user preferences, settings, or small amounts of data.
        * Access via `Context.getSharedPreferences()`.
        * Operations are synchronous on the UI thread by default (use `apply()` for asynchronous writes).
        * **Jetpack DataStore:** The recommended modern alternative. Provides asynchronous API (using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow), handles data migration, and ensures type safety (with Proto DataStore).
    * **Room Persistence Library:**
        * An abstraction layer over SQLite that allows for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
        * Part of Jetpack. Reduces boilerplate and verifies queries at compile time.
        * **`@Entity`:** Represents a table in the database. Each instance is a row.
        * **`@Dao` (Data Access Object):** Contains methods to access the database (queries, inserts, updates, deletes). Methods can be `suspend` for one-shot operations or return `Flow` for observable queries.
        * **`@Database`:** Represents the database holder. Extends `RoomDatabase`. Defines entities and provides access to DAOs. Typically implemented as a singleton.
        * **Migrations:** When your database schema changes (e.g., adding/modifying tables/columns), you must provide `Migration` objects to preserve user data. Otherwise, the app might crash or data will be lost if `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` is used (avoid in production).
        * **Coroutines & Flow:** Room has excellent support for Kotlin Coroutines. DAO methods can be `suspend` functions or return `Flow<T>` to observe data changes reactively.
    * **Repository Pattern:** It's a common best practice to create a Repository class that abstracts data sources (network, local database, SharedPreferences). The ViewModel interacts with the Repository, not directly with DAOs or ApiServices. This improves separation of concerns and testability.

## üîü Dependency Injection

Integrate Hilt for managing dependencies effectively in your Android application.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [Dependency Injection in Android](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
    * [Hilt User Guide](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
    * [Hilt with Jetpack (ViewModel, Navigation, WorkManager)](https://dagger.dev/hilt/jetpack)
    * [Hilt testing guide](https://dagger.dev/hilt/testing)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Set up Hilt in your project: Add the Hilt plugin and dependencies to your `build.gradle` files. Create an Application class annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp` and declare it in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    2.  Create a Hilt module file (e.g., `AppModule.kt`) and use `@Provides` methods within it to tell Hilt how to create instances of dependencies like your `ApiService`, `AppDatabase`, `UserDao`, and `AppPreferences`. Install the module in the appropriate component (e.g., `SingletonComponent`).
    3.  Refactor your `LocalDataViewModel` (from Section 9) to use Hilt. Add the `@HiltViewModel` annotation and use `@Inject constructor` to receive `AppPreferences` and `UserDao` instances. Update the corresponding screen composable (`LocalDataScreen`) to obtain the ViewModel using `hiltViewModel()`.
    4.  Create a `Repository` class (e.g., `UserRepository`) that takes `UserDao` and `ApiService` as dependencies via constructor injection. This repository will be responsible for fetching user data (e.g., from API and saving to Room, or fetching from Room). Provide this `UserRepository` using Hilt and inject it into a ViewModel.
    5.  Research Hilt's `@EntryPoint` annotation. What is it used for, and when might you need it (e.g., accessing Hilt dependencies from classes not directly supported by Hilt)?

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **Dependency Injection (DI):** A design pattern where objects receive their dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally. This promotes loose coupling, easier testing, and better code organization.
    * **Hilt:** Dagger Hilt is a DI library for Android that simplifies Dagger setup and usage. It's Android's recommended DI solution.
    * **`@HiltAndroidApp`:** Annotate your Application class to enable Hilt.
    * **`@AndroidEntryPoint`:** Annotate Android components like Activities, Fragments, Services, BroadcastReceivers if Hilt needs to inject dependencies into them (not typically needed for Composable-only screens if ViewModels are the main Hilt entry points used via `hiltViewModel()`).
    * **`@HiltViewModel`:** Annotate ViewModels so Hilt can create and provide them.
    * **`@Inject constructor(...)`:** Used for constructor injection. Hilt will automatically know how to create instances of classes with this annotation if it knows how to provide their dependencies.
    * **`@Module` & `@Provides`:** Hilt modules are classes annotated with `@Module`. They contain methods annotated with `@Provides` that tell Hilt how to create instances of types that cannot be constructor-injected (e.g., interfaces, classes from external libraries, or objects requiring complex setup like Room database).
    * **`@InstallIn(...)`:** Specifies the Hilt component where the bindings in a module should be installed (e.g., `SingletonComponent` for application-wide singletons, `ViewModelComponent` for ViewModel-scoped bindings).
    * **Component Scopes:** Hilt provides different scopes (e.g., `@Singleton`, `@ActivityScoped`, `@ViewModelScoped`) to manage the lifecycle of provided dependencies.
    * **`hiltViewModel()`:** Composable function from `androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose` used to obtain a Hilt-provided ViewModel in a Composable.
    * **Benefits of DI with Hilt:**
        * Reduced boilerplate for DI.
        * Standardized DI across the app.
        * Easier testing by providing mock dependencies.
        * Improved code maintainability and scalability.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Animations and Motion

Bring your UI to life with Jetpack Compose's powerful and intuitive animation APIs.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [Animation in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation)
    * [Simple animations (animate*AsState)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation/value-based)
    * [Visibility animation (AnimatedVisibility)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation/composables#animatedvisibility)
    * [Animation between contents (Crossfade, AnimatedContent)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation/composables#animatedcontent)
    * [State-based animations (updateTransition)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation/complex)
    * [Compose Animation Samples](https://github.com/android/compose-samples) (Search for animation examples)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the animations demo file.
    2.  Modify the `animateColorAsState` example to use a different `animationSpec`, like `spring()` or `keyframes { ... }`. Observe the difference in motion.
    3.  In the `AnimatedVisibility` example, change the `enter` and `exit` transitions (e.g., use `scaleIn`/`scaleOut` or `expandHorizontally`/`shrinkHorizontally`).
    4.  Explore `Crossfade`. Add two different composables (e.g., a `Text` and an `Image`) and use `Crossfade` to switch between them based on a state variable (e.g., a boolean toggled by a button).
    5.  Research `updateTransition`. Use it to animate multiple properties (e.g., color, size, alpha) of a composable simultaneously based on a common state change (like a button being pressed or idle).

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **`animate*AsState`:** The simplest way to animate a single value change (Color, Dp, Float, Int, Offset, Size, etc.). Provide the `targetValue` and Compose animates smoothly from the current value.
    * **`AnimationSpec`:** Defines the physics or timing of an animation (e.g., `tween` for duration/easing, `spring` for physics-based motion, `keyframes` for complex sequences).
    * **`AnimatedVisibility`:** Animates the appearance and disappearance of its content. Define `enter` and `exit` transitions (e.g., `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `slideInVertically`, `scaleIn`).
    * **`AnimatedContent`:** Animates when its `targetState` changes, transitioning between the old content and the new content. Requires defining a `transitionSpec`. Good for animating changes like counters, text updates, or switching between small UI elements.
    * **`Crossfade`:** A simpler version of `AnimatedContent` specifically for fading between two composables based on a `targetState`.
    * **`updateTransition`:** Used for animating multiple values simultaneously based on a single state change. Create a `Transition` object and use extension functions like `transition.animateFloat`, `transition.animateColor`. Offers more control for complex state-driven animations.
    * **`rememberInfiniteTransition`:** For creating repeating animations (e.g., pulsing, loading indicators).
    * **Gesture-based Animations:** Combine animation APIs with gesture detection (`Modifier.pointerInput`, `Modifier.draggable`) for interactive animations like swipe-to-dismiss.
    * **Performance:** While Compose animations are generally performant, be mindful of animating too many complex properties simultaneously. Profile your app if you notice jank. Avoid triggering unnecessary recompositions within animation blocks.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing and Debugging

Ensure the quality and correctness of your Compose code through automated testing and effective debugging techniques.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [Testing Jetpack Compose UI](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing)
    * [Compose Test Cheat Sheet](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing-cheatsheet)
    * [Unit Testing Kotlin Code](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing) (General principles apply to ViewModels, Repositories etc.)
    * [Espresso Setup and Basics](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) (Primarily for View-based UI or hybrid apps)
    * [Layout Inspector in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/layout-inspector)
    * [Compose Debugging](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling#compose-debugging)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Set up the testing dependencies (`androidx.compose.ui.test*`, `junit`, `androidx.test.ext:junit`, `turbine`) in your `build.gradle`.
    2.  Create a UI test file (e.g., `MyFeatureScreenTest.kt`) in the `src/androidTest` directory. Add a `Modifier.testTag("MyIncrementButton")` to the increment button in your screen's content composable. Modify the test to find the button using `onNodeWithTag` and perform a click action, asserting that the corresponding callback was invoked.
    3.  Create a unit test file (e.g., `MyFeatureViewModelTest.kt`) in the `src/test` directory. Write a new test case for the `updateLegacyData` function (from the ViewModel example in Section 7), asserting that the `LiveData` value is updated correctly. (You'll need the `InstantTaskExecutorRule` for testing LiveData).
    4.  In your UI test file (`MyFeatureScreenTest`), write a test to verify that when the `uiState.errorMessage` is not null in the ViewModel, the error message `Text` composable is displayed on the screen.
    5.  Run the Layout Inspector on your app while it's running. Explore the component tree, view attributes, and enable and observe recomposition counts.

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **UI Testing (Instrumentation Tests - `androidTest` source set):**
        * Run on a device or emulator. Test the actual rendered UI.
        * **`ComposeTestRule`:** The main entry point (`createComposeRule` or `createAndroidComposeRule`). Use it to set content, find UI elements (nodes), perform actions, and make assertions.
        * **Finding Nodes:** Use semantics: `onNodeWithText`, `onNodeWithTag`, `onNodeWithContentDescription`, or custom semantic properties/matchers. `TestTag` (`Modifier.testTag("...")`) is the most reliable way.
        * **Actions:** `performClick()`, `performScrollTo()`, `performTextInput()`, etc.
        * **Assertions:** `assertIsDisplayed()`, `assertIsEnabled()`, `assertTextEquals()`, `assertContentDescriptionEquals()`, etc.
        * **Synchronization:** Compose tests automatically synchronize with the UI, waiting for recompositions and animations to settle (most of the time). `waitForIdle()` can be used manually if needed.
    * **Unit Testing (`test` source set):**
        * Run on the local JVM (faster). Test individual classes/functions in isolation (ViewModels, Repositories, UseCases, Utils).
        * Use standard testing frameworks like JUnit4/JUnit5.
        * **Mocking:** Use libraries like Mockito (`mockito-kotlin`) to mock dependencies (e.g., mock `ApiService` or `UserDao` when testing a ViewModel).
        * **Coroutine Testing:** Use `kotlinx-coroutines-test`. Set up a `TestDispatcher` (`StandardTestDispatcher`, `UnconfinedTestDispatcher`), use `runTest` scope, and potentially `Dispatchers.setMain`/`resetMain`.
        * **Flow Testing:** Use libraries like Turbine (`app.cash.turbine:turbine`) to easily test emissions from `StateFlow` or `SharedFlow`.
        * **LiveData Testing:** Requires `androidx.arch.core:core-testing` for `InstantTaskExecutorRule` to run background tasks synchronously.
    * **Debugging Tools:**
        * **Layout Inspector:** Visualize the Composable hierarchy, inspect parameters and modifiers of each composable, check recomposition counts (requires enabling in settings). Essential for understanding UI structure and performance issues.
        * **Hierarchy Viewer:** (Legacy, less useful for Compose) Inspect the traditional View hierarchy.
        * **Logcat:** Standard Android logging. Add logs in your composables or ViewModels.
        * **Breakpoints:** Set breakpoints in your Kotlin code (including within composable lambdas) and use the debugger.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization

Understand how Compose renders UI and learn techniques to ensure your application runs smoothly.

* **üìé Documentation & References:**
    * [Compose performance](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/performance)
    * [Debugging Recomposition](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling/tracing) (Using Layout Inspector or Android Studio Electric Eel+ recomposition highlighting)
    * [Compose phases](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/phases)
    * [Optimizing Lazy lists](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lists#performance)
    * [derivedStateOf](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#derivedstateof)
    * [Android Studio Profilers (CPU, Memory)](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile)

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Create the performance concepts demo file. Run the app and observe Logcat. Type into the TextField and watch how often different composables recompose based on the logs. Shuffle the list and observe the logs for list item recomposition.
    2.  Comment out the `key` parameter in the `items` function of the `LazyColumn` example. Run the app again, shuffle the list, and compare the list item recomposition logs. What's the difference in behavior?
    3.  Modify the `ExpensiveCalculationResult` example: Change the calculation (e.g., to `inputValue.reversed()`). Test `derivedStateOf` again. When does the "Performing expensive calculation!" log appear now compared to when the input state changes?
    4.  Enable recomposition counts in the Layout Inspector (if using a compatible Android Studio version). Run the app and observe the counts for different composables as you interact with the UI. Identify composables that recompose frequently.
    5.  Research the concept of "stability" in Compose regarding input parameters for composables. How does passing unstable parameters (like a lambda that isn't remembered, or certain collection types) affect Compose's ability to skip recomposition?

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **Recomposition:** Compose redraws the UI by re-running relevant `@Composable` functions when their input `State` changes. This is the core update mechanism.
    * **Smart Recomposition:** Compose tries to be smart and only recomposes functions whose inputs have actually changed (if the inputs are "stable"). It can also *skip* recomposing children if the parent recomposes but the children's stable inputs remain the same.
    * **Performance Pitfalls:**
        * **Unnecessary Recomposition:** Recomposing large parts of the UI too often or when not needed (often due to unstable parameters or reading state too high up the tree).
        * **Expensive Calculations in Composables:** Performing heavy work directly within composable functions that run frequently.
        * **Inefficient List Handling:** Not using `key`s in lazy lists/grids, causing excessive item recomposition on list changes.
    * **Optimization Techniques:**
        * **`remember` / `rememberSaveable`:** Avoid recreating objects or state on every recomposition. Use them for state and calculations that only need to happen once or when specific inputs change. Remember lambdas if passing them down to prevent instability.
        * **State Hoisting & Scope Limitation:** Keep state reads as localized as possible. If only a small part of the UI needs a state, don't make the entire screen recompose when it changes. Hoist state only as high as necessary. Pass lambdas to defer state reads.
        * **`derivedStateOf`:** Use when a calculation depends on one or more `State` objects, but you only want the calculation (and subsequent recomposition of readers) to happen when the *result* of the calculation changes, not just when the input states change.
        * **Provide `key`s in Lazy Lists/Grids:** Crucial for performance. Use stable and unique identifiers (`item.id`, etc.) for the `key` lambda in `items(...)`. This helps Compose track items efficiently across data changes.
        * **Use Stable Parameters:** Prefer passing stable types (primitives, strings, stable data classes, remembered lambdas) to composables to allow Compose to skip recomposition effectively. Avoid unstable collections like `List` directly; consider immutable collections or wrapping them.
        * **Defer Reads:** Read state values as late as possible. Pass lambdas that read state down (`onClick = { viewModel.doSomething(stateValue) }`) instead of passing the state value itself if the child doesn't always need it during composition.
        * **Optimize Layouts:** Avoid excessively deep layout nesting. Use `ConstraintLayout` for complex flat hierarchies. Understand intrinsic measurements. Use `Modifier.then()` appropriately.
    * **Profiling Tools:**
        * **Layout Inspector (Recomposition Counts):** Identify which composables are recomposing frequently.
        * **Android Studio Profiler (CPU):** Use "System Trace" (perfetto) and look for "Compose" sections to analyze composition, layout, and draw phases. Identify long frames (jank).
        * **Compose Compiler Metrics:** Generate reports on the stability of parameters passed to composables.

* **üìù Detailed Examples:**

  **Exercise:**
    1.  Implement basic permission handling for `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` using `rememberLauncherForActivityResult`. Show a button to request it and display the permission status as Text.
    2.  Create a custom composable `RatingBar` that displays a number of stars (e.g., using `Icon`) based on an integer `rating` input, allowing the user to tap a star to change the rating via an `onRatingChanged: (Int) -> Unit` callback. Make it stateless.
    3.  Use `snapshotFlow` inside a `LaunchedEffect` to observe a `mutableStateOf<Int>` counter. Log a message via the flow whenever the counter value is a multiple of 5.
    4.  Add `Modifier.animateContentSize()` to a `Column` that contains text. Add a Button that toggles showing/hiding additional text within that column, and observe the smooth size change animation.
    5.  Research how to enqueue a simple `OneTimeWorkRequest` using WorkManager from a ViewModel (you don't need to implement the Worker itself, just the enqueueing part using `WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(...)`). Describe the basic steps involved.

* **üìå Key Concepts & Notes:**
    * **Build Upon Fundamentals:** Advanced topics often combine core concepts like State, Side Effects, Modifiers, and Layouts in more complex ways.
    * **Separation of Concerns:** Essential for managing complexity. Keep UI logic (Composables), state management/business logic (ViewModels, UseCases), and data access (Repositories, DAOs, API Services) separate.
    * **Leverage Libraries:** Use established Jetpack libraries (WorkManager, Paging, Navigation, Room) and potentially community utilities where appropriate, rather than reinventing the wheel.
    * **Customization Power:** Compose offers deep customization through custom layouts (`Layout` composable) and drawing (`Canvas`) when needed, but prefer standard components first.
    * **Testability:** Maintain testability even with advanced features by using DI, stateless composables, and clear state management patterns.
    * **Permissions Handling:** Request permissions contextually using `rememberLauncherForActivityResult`. Clearly explain why the permission is needed. Handle both granted and denied states gracefully.
    * **Custom Layouts:** Use the `Layout` composable for full control over measurement and placement when standard layouts don't suffice. Understand the measure/layout phases.
    * **Advanced State/Side-Effects:** `snapshotFlow` bridges Compose State to Kotlin Flow. `produceState` bridges callback/suspending sources to Compose State. Understand the Compose phases (Composition, Layout, Draw) for deeper debugging.
    * **WorkManager:** For reliable, deferrable background work. Integrate via Repository/ViewModel. Observe work status using `WorkInfo`.
    * **Community & Documentation:** The Compose ecosystem is evolving. Stay updated with official documentation, blogs, and community resources for best practices and new APIs.
